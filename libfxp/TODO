add support for secure tunneling

maybe make fxp_data_receive() call recv() more than once, to fill up buffer, if
  data still available and haven't read to buffer capacity yet

maybe the grabbing of the "150" code upon data connection establishment should happen INSIDE _establish(), so the calling dude only has to know whether it failed

prolly should add like a "fxp_supports()" and you can ask it, for example, whether it supports wildcards.  then it might run a test "NLST *.*" and if that fails, it knows.  something to tell whether the server supports a given feature

implement a "batch" mode where commands are queued up and sent out at one time, then codes received all at once, to circumvent latency issues
